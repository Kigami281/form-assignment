# Form Implementation Project

## Description
This project contains a semantic HTML form based on provided specifications, demonstrating best practices in HTML structure and accessibility.

## Purpose
The form collects user information such as personal details, contact info, and preferences, organized into logical sections.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the complete, semantic HTML form.
- `README.md`: Documentation about the project.

## Implementation Approach
The form uses semantic tags (`<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`) to structure data logically and accessibly. Proper labeling and input types ensure usability and accessibility.

## How to Use
Open `index.html` in a web browser to view and interact with the form.
